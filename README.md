# Next.js 15 useRouter Hook Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using the `next/router` hook in Next.js 15 within components that aren't directly associated with page routes.  The problem arises because the `router` object might not be properly initialized in such contexts, leading to unexpected errors or undefined behavior.

## Issue Description
The `useRouter` hook in Next.js is designed for components associated with page routes. Using it in other contexts might not provide the fully initialized `router` object you need for navigation or other functionalities.

## Solution
The solution involves restructuring the component tree to ensure that the component using `useRouter` is within the render tree of a page component, or alternatively using a suitable alternative approach for navigation.
